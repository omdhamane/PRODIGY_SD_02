Guessing Game – GUI Based Application
📖 Project Description

This project is a GUI-based Guessing Game developed as part of the Software Development Internship at Prodigy Infotech.

The application generates a random number and challenges the user to guess it. Based on the user’s input, the program provides feedback such as Too High, Too Low, or Correct, and tracks the number of attempts taken to guess the number correctly.

🎯 Features

Graphical User Interface built using Python Tkinter

Difficulty levels:

Easy (1–50)

Medium (1–100)

Hard (1–200)

Real-time feedback based on how close the guess is

Live attempt counter

Keyboard support (Press Enter to submit guess)

Modern dark-themed user interface

Restart game option


🛠 Technologies Used

Python 3

Tkinter (GUI library)

Random module



🧠 Concepts Implemented

Random number generation

Conditional statements

User input validation

Event handling

GUI layout design

Game logic implementation

🖥 User Interface

The application follows a modern card-based UI design with a clean layout and proper spacing to improve user experience.
